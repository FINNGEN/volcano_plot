Welcome to LAVAA! LAVAA is an interactive tool to generate genetic volcano plots for 
simultaneously evaluating the p-value and the effect size at a single SNP across a 
range of traits from a large set of GWAS. This folder contains both the stand-alone version that works on a browser and has three sample data sets for you to try. The second folder contains a React component for implementation on FinnGen's services.
